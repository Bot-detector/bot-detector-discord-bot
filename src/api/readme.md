`api`: This directory contains the API layer of the application. It contains the API router, it is where you add the API endpoints.

for each version of the api route we will create a folder:

- `v1`: the first version of the api route
    - `events`: all endpoints related to events
    - `monitoring`: all endpoints related to monitoring
    - `verification`: all endpoints related to user verification
